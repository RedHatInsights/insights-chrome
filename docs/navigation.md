# Navigation

Chrome leverages [Cloud Services Config](https://github.com/redhatinsights/cloud-services-config) (CSC) to build the navigation on a bundle-by-bundle basis.

## Dynamic Navigation

Along with static navigation set in CSC, apps can opt into dynamic navigation by updating the `main.yml` file with a few options:

### Permissions

List of available permissions methods:

* `isOrgAdmin` - test if logged in user is organization admin
* `isActive` - test if logged in user is active
* `isInternal` - test if logged in user is internal
* `isEntitled` - test if logged in user is entitled, entitlements to check for is passed as an argument
* `isProd` - test if current environment is production (prod-beta and prod-stable)
* `isBeta` - test if current environment is beta (ci-beta, qa-beta and prod-beta)
* `hasPermissions` - test if current user has rbac role permissions ['app:scope:permission'], uses logical AND to evaluate the permissions
* `loosePermissions` - similar to `hasPermissions`, uses logical OR to evaluate the permissions
* `apiRequest` - call custom API endpoint to test if the item should be displayed.
  * Expects `true`/`false` response.
  * `accessor` attribute can be specified. If the boolean value is in nested object. The accessor is a string path of [lodash get](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#get) function.
  * If the promise receives an error, the item won't be displayed.
  * `matcher`: `['isEmpty' | 'isNotEmpty']`.
    * `isEmpty` uses [lodash isEmpty](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isEmpty) to evaluate api response.
    * `isNotEmpty` is a negation of `isEmpty`

#### apiRequest example

```yml
 app:
  title: App title
  api:
    versions:
      - v1
  frontend:
    paths:
      - /foo/bar
    sub_apps:
      - id: sub-app-one
        title: sub-app-one
      - id: dynamic-sub-app
        title: dynamic-sub-app
        permissions:
          method: apiRequest
          args: # acceps all axios request config options https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config
            - url: "/request/url"
              foo: bar
 ```

#### Multiple permissions example

Each nav item can have multiple required permissions. If **all checks are successful** the item will display.

```yml
app:
  title: App title
  api:
    versions:
      - v1
  frontend:
    paths:
      - /foo/bar
    sub_apps:
      - id: 'sub-app-one'
        title: 'Sub app one'
    permissions:
        - method: apiRequest
          args:
            - url: '/foo/bar'
              show: true
        - method: hasPermissions
          args:
            - [catalog:portfolios:create]
```
